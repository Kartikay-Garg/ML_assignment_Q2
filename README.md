ML Assignment Ques 2
```
Q-2. Imagine you have a dataset where you have different features like Age ,
Gender , Height , Weight , BMI , and Blood Pressure and you have to classify the people into
different classes like Normal , Overweight , Obesity , Underweight , and Extreme Obesity by using
any 4 different classification algorithms. Now you have to build a model which
can classify people into different classes.
Dataset This is the Dataset You can use this dataset for this question.

## This dataset represents data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition.

>The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records

> The records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level),

> That allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.

>The attributes related with eating habits are:

>>Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC),

>>Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC),

>>Number of main meals (NCP),

>>Consumption of food between meals (CAEC),

>>Consumption of water daily (CH20),

>>and Consumption of alcohol (CALC).

>The attributes related with the physical condition are:

>>Calories consumption monitoring (SCC),

>>Physical activity frequency (FAF),

>>Time using technology devices (TUE),

>>Transportation used (MTRANS),

>other variables obtained were: Gender, Age, Height and Weight. 

>Finally, all data was labeled and the class variable NObesity was created with the values of: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III, based on Equation (1) and information from WHO and Mexican Normativity. The data contains numerical data and continous data, so it can be used for analysis based on algorithms of classification, prediction, segmentation and association. Data is available in CSV format and ARFF format to be used with the Weka tool.
